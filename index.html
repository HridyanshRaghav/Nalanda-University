        <h4 class="AH">Asian History:-</h4>
    <p><h5 class="Asian">Nalanda University was established to emulate the ancient Buddhist university of Nalanda (Nalanda mahavihara), which functioned between the 5th and 13th centuries. The idea to resurrect Nalanda University was endorsed in 2007 at the 2nd East Asia Summit by the sixteen member countries. In 2009, during the 4th East Asia summit, ASEAN member states including Australia, China, Korea, Singapore and Japan promised further support. The Government of Bihar handed over land acquired from local people, to the university for its new campus. Chief Minister of Bihar Nitish Kumar also met External Affairs Minister SM Krishna to receive reassurance that the Central Government would allocate sufficient funds to the project.</h5></p>
